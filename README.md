Hi! I'm Arisha Islam, a student at HTHS (Class of '28) who loves art, writing, and reading!

I'm currently working several projects, so do look forward to those.

In terms of learning, I'm quite interested in HTML, CSS, game dev with Renpy, and, of course, machine learning! I'm always up for constructive criticism too!

You can reach me through any of the links in my bio.

Have an awesome day :)
