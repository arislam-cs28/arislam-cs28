I'm currently working on a VN (do look forward to that lol, it's my first major project), an app (hooray!), and my personal portfolio (cause I have no clue how else to keep track of my work).

In terms of learning, I'm quite interested in HTML, CSS, game dev with Renpy, and, of course, machine learning! Who doesn't love some good ol' data science?

I'm always up for constructive criticism and help with coding because I'm new to the scene, lol.

Fun fact: I write a lot and read even more! 

You can reach me through any of the links in my bio!
